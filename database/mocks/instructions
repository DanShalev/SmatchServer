1. Import mock table
--------------------
Every time someone update the mock table,
each user will have to load the table locally (only once).
Once we will have a shared server this won't be needed.

To do so, we will have a shared sql file with all the inserted data, saved at:
> $BE_git_repo/database/mocks/tie_db_scheme.sql

Just execute it (after running the server, which creates the table) to fill the table with data.

2. Export mock table
----------------------
If you update the tables and want to save them and share it,
You can use the following command to auto generate sql insertion script:

> /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqldump -u root -p tie_db > ...yourfullpath../database/mocks/tie_db_scheme.sql

keep in mind you will need to clean it, it contains a lot other sql stuff except table insertion.

Once finished, commit the generated file in your branch.
